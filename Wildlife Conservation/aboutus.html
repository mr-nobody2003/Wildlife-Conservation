       <h4>Natural Heritage Campaigns</h4>
       <p>Natural Heritage Campaigns in WTI has spanned species and has led to success 
        like the rehabilitation of Kalandars (Bear dancing) community, the 'Say no to Shahtoosh' 
        campaign to stop the hinting of the Tibetan Antelope, the 'Tibetan Awareness Campaign' aimed at 
        stopping the use of wildlife products and derivatives in the culture, The 'Mongoose Hair Brush Campaign' 
        to expose the illegal trade in mongoose hair to manufacture paint brushes, 'Animal Action Education' 
        to bring about environmental education and awareness among school children, and the 'Wild Buffalo Campaign' 
        to instil a sense of pride and ownership for the State Animal of Chhattisgarh.</p>

        <h4>Wild Lands</h4>
        <p>Land securement is a unique strategy that aims to secure critical habitats outside the traditional 
            protected area system. The secured lands include important habitat linkages, wetlands, mangroves, grasslands, 
            Important Bird Areas (IBAs), sacred groves etc. The focus of this Big Idea is to secure critical habitats and 
            restore degraded and fragmented ecosystems like coral reefs, wetlands and mangroves.
            Presently, the division has five projects under it the Garo Green Spine Conservation Project, Meghalaya;
            Kannur Kandal Project, Kerala; Sarus Habitat Securement Project, Uttar Pradesh; Mithapur Coral Reef 
            Recovery Project, Gujarat; and the latest addition is the Forgotten Cats of Shergaon in Arunachal Pradesh</p>

            <h4>Species Recovery</h4>
            <p>Our species recovery projects reflect long-term organisational commitment and are selected after careful thought 
                is given to the conservation status of the species, conservation relevance of a project, resource availability, 
                local support, and government priorities.</p>

            <h4>Wild Lands</h4>
            <p>Under the "WILD LANDS" project we go on for spotting terrestrial,aquatic animals or spotting birds.
              This helps us to keep an account of the sorrunding animals that are living.We try to understand the 
              behaviour of animals.This helps us keep acount of different species found and their numbers.

            <h4>Rescue Operations</h4>
            <p>Wildlife rescue operations involve a series of coordinated efforts to assist and aid injured, sick, 
              or distressed wild animals. These operations aim to provide immediate care, rehabilitation, and, 
              when possible, release back into their natural habitat. </p>

            <h4>Vaccinating Operations</h4>
            <p>Wildlife vaccination aims to control the spread of diseases that can impact animal populations,
               public health, or domestic animals.Vaccinating endangered or threatened species against certain 
               diseases can be crucial for their survival. Diseases like canine distemper or avian influenza 
               can devastate vulnerable wildlife populations.Some diseases can transfer between wildlife and humans. 
               Vaccinating wildlife against such diseases can mitigate the risk of transmission to humans.</p>
